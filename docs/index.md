# AWS CloudFormation + Steampipe

An [AWS CloudFormation template file](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/resources/templates/) is used to declare resources, variables, modules, and more.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query data using SQL.

Query all resources in your AWS CloudFormation files:

```sql
select
  name,
  type,
  jsonb_pretty(properties) as properties
from
  awscfn_resource;
```

```sh
+------------+------------------+---------------------------------------+
| name       | type             | properties                            |

## Documentation

- **[Table definitions & examples â†’](/plugins/turbot/awscfn/tables)**

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest AWS CloudFormation plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install awscfn
```

### Credentials

No credentials are required.

### Configuration

Installing the latest awscfn plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/awscfn.spc`) with a single connection named `awscfn`:

```hcl
connection "awscfn" {
  plugin = "awscfn"

  # Paths is a list of locations to search for CloudFormation template files
  # All paths are resolved relative to the current working directory (CWD)
  # Wildcard based searches are supported, including recursive searches

  # Defaults to CWD
  paths = ["*.template", "*.yaml", "*.yml", "*.json"]
}
```

- `paths` - A list of directory paths to search for AWS CloudFormation template files. Paths are resolved relative to the current working directory. Paths may [include wildcards](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) and also support `**` for recursive matching. Defaults to the current working directory.

### Setting up paths

The argument `paths` in the config is a list of directory paths, a GitHub repository URL, or a S3 URL to search for AWS CloudFormation template files. Paths may [include wildcards](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) and also support `**` for recursive matching. Defaults to the current working directory. For example:

```hcl
connection "awscfn" {
  plugin = "awscfn"

  paths = [
    "*.template",
    "~/*.template",
    "github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates//*.template",
    "github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates//aws/services/ElasticLoadBalancing//*.yaml",
    "git::https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates.git//aws/services/ElasticLoadBalancing//*.yaml",
    "s3::https://demo-integrated-2022.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/template_examples//*.yaml"
  ]
}
```

#### Configuring local file paths

You can define a list of local directory paths to search for AWS CloudFormation template files. Paths are resolved relative to the current working directory. For example:

- `*.template` matches all CloudFormation template files in the CWD.
- `**/*.template` matches all CloudFormation template files in the CWD and all sub-directories.
- `../*.template` matches all CloudFormation template files in the CWD's parent directory.
- `ELB*.template` matches all CloudFormation template files starting with "ELB" in the CWD.
- `/path/to/dir/*.template` matches all CloudFormation template files in a specific directory. For example:
  - `~/*.template` matches all CloudFormation template files in the home directory.
  - `~/**/*.template` matches all CloudFormation template files recursively in the home directory.
- `/path/to/dir/main.template` matches a specific file.

```hcl
connection "awscfn" {
  plugin = "awscfn"

  paths = [ "*.template", "~/*.template", "/path/to/dir/main.template" ]
}
```

**NOTE:** If paths includes `*`, all files (including non-CloudFormation template files) in the CWD will be matched, which may cause errors if incompatible file types exist.

#### Configuring GitHub URLs

You can define a list of URL as input to search for AWS CloudFormation template files from a variety of protocols. For example:

- `github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates//*.template` matches all top-level CloudFormation template files in the specified github repository.
- `github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates//**/*.yaml` matches all CloudFormation template files in the specified github repository and all sub-directories.
- `github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates?ref=fix_7677//**/*.template` matches all CloudFormation template files in the specific tag of github repository.
- `git::https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates.git//aws/services/ElasticLoadBalancing//*.yaml` matches all CloudFormation template files in the given HTTP URL using the Git protocol.

If you want to download only a specific subdirectory from a downloaded directory, you can specify a subdirectory after a double-slash (`//`).

- `github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates//aws/services/ElasticLoadBalancing//*.yaml` matches all CloudFormation template files in the specific folder of a github repository.

```hcl
connection "awscfn" {
  plugin = "awscfn"

  paths = [ "github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates//*.template", "github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates//aws/services/ElasticLoadBalancing//*.yaml", "git::https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates.git//aws/services/ElasticLoadBalancing//*.yaml" ]
}
```

#### Configuring S3 URLs

You can also pass a S3 bucket URL to search all CloudFormation template files stored in the specified S3 bucket. For example:

- `s3::https://demo-integrated-2022.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/template_examples//*.yaml` matches all the CloudFormation template files recursively.

```hcl
connection "awscfn" {
  plugin = "awscfn"

  paths = [ "s3::https://demo-integrated-2022.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/template_examples//*.yaml" ]
}
```
